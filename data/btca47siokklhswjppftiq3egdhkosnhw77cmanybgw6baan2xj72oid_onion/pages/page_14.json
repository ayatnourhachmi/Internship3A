We've thoroughly studied the Bitcoin client \r\nfrom within and have found an almost imperceptible but very significant \r\nflaw (associated with the commission), using it we have committed a \r\nBitcoin transaction in which the recipient has received more Bitcoins \r\nthan the sender has sent. Unfortunately, the difference is not so great \r\n(about 1%) and if you make only one transaction by a small amount your \r\ncapital will not increase much, but if you make transactions permanently\r\n and by a large amount, you can get rich very quickly.\n         <br/>\n         <br/>\n         â\r\n We've \r\ndiscovered this flaw recently and have not yet managed to win a lot, but\r\n every day we multiply our money tenfold times and want to do it \r\nmore. We all understand that such a freebie can not continue for a lot \r\nof time and this flaw will be found and corrected in the near future, \r\nbut until that happens, we want to win as much as possible. That is why \r\nwe have launched this website, where you can make an investment and we \r\nwill multiply it twenty times.
