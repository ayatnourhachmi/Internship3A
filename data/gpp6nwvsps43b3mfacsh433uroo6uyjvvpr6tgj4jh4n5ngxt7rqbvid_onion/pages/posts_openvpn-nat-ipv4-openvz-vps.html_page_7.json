All 4.3 billion IPv4 addresses have now been exhausted, and their cost has risen to the point where an IPv4 address can be a major part of the cost of a low-end server.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     Virtualizing with OpenVZ or LXC gives further cost savings. The Linux kernel is shared between many virtual machines, so each machine needs less memory of its own. You can create a useful server with as little as 128 MB of RAM.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     By sharing a single IPv4 address and reducing the RAM, providers can offer you a server for as little as $4/year. The NAT IPv4 providers I’ve heard of are\n     <a href=\"https://mrvm.net\" target=\"_blank\">\n      MrVM\n     </a>\n     ,\n     <a href=\"https://inceptionhosting.com\" target=\"_blank\">\n      Inception Hosting\n     </a>\n     ,\n     <a href=\"https://hosting.gullo.me\" target=\"_blank\">\n      Gullo’s Hosting\n     </a>\n     , and\n     <a href=\"https://webhorizon.in\" target=\"_blank\">\n      WebHorizon\n     </a>\n     . There may be others.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     This tutorial shows you how to install OpenVPN on a NAT IPv4 OpenVZ VPS, using the Nyr OpenVPN installer script. The procedure for the Angristan OpenVPN installer script is similar.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     OpenVPN has pros and cons. The pros are that it has been field-tested for many years, its security has been externally audited, and clients exist for all the common platforms. The main con is that it is blocked in several countries.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     If you are going to follow along with this tutorial, you should also check that your VPS provider’s IP address(es) are reachable from your country. NAT IPv4 servers are very popular, and at least one country has blocked the IP addresses of at least one provider.\n    </p>\n    <h2>\n     <a id=\"1\">\n     </a>\n     1. Server\n    </h2>\n    <h3>\n     <a id=\"1-1\">\n     </a>\n     1.1. Enable TUN/TAP\n    </h3>\n    <p>\n     TUN and TAP are interfaces that exist only in software.\n    </p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>\n      A TUN (short for TUNnel) interface operates at level 3 of the\n      <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model\" target=\"_blank\">\n       Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model\n      </a>\n      , the packet routing level.\n     </li>\n     <li>\n      A TAP (short for Test Access Point) interface operates lower down, at level 2 of the OSI model. You must use TAP if you want to build a network bridge.\n     </li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>\n     In this tutorial we will use a TUN interface.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     While OpenVZ does support VPN inside a container, you must explicitly enable TUN/TAP for the container. Most providers allow you to do this from their control panel. The appearance of the control panel will vary from provider to provider. On MrVM, it looks as shown below. Scroll down to the\n     <strong>\n      VPS Management\n     </strong>\n     section, and click\n     <strong>\n      VPS Configuration\n     </strong>\n     .\n    </p>\n    <img alt=\"VPS Configuration in OpenVZ\" src=\"../images/openvz-1.png\"/>\n    <p>\n     In the\n     <strong>\n      VPS Configuration\n     </strong>\n     box, check\n     <strong>\n      Enable Tun/Tap\n     </strong>\n     .\n    </p>\n    <img alt=\"Enable TUN/TAP in OpenVZ\" src=\"../images/openvz-2.png\"/>\n    <p>\n     Click\n     <strong>\n      Submit\n     </strong>\n     . Wait while TUN/TAP is enabled.\n    </p>\n    <h3>\n     <a id=\"1-2\">\n     </a>\n     1.2. Install Legacy Iptables\n    </h3>\n    <p>\n     There is a special consideration if you are running Debian 10. The distribution is transitioning between iptables and nftables. Although it looks like you’re getting iptables, it’s actually nftables under the hood. To set it back to pure iptables, SSH into the server, and switch to the legacy version of iptables:\n    </p>\n    <blockquote>\n     <code>\n      apt install iptables\n     </code>\n    </blockquote>\n    <blockquote>\n     <code>\n      update-alternatives --set iptables /usr/sbin/iptables-legacy\n     </code>\n    </blockquote>\n    <blockquote>\n     <code>\n      update-alternatives --set ip6tables /usr/sbin/ip6tables-legacy\n     </code>\n    </blockquote>\n    <h3>\n     <a id=\"1-3\">\n     </a>\n     1.3. Reboot\n    </h3>\n    <p>\n     After enabling TUN/TAP and installing legacy iptables, you should reboot:\n    </p>\n    <blockquote>\n     <code>\n      reboot\n     </code>\n    </blockquote>\n    <h3>\n     <a id=\"1-4\">\n     </a>\n     1.4. Check Kernel\n    </h3>\n    <p>\n     We’ll do some final checks before installing OpenVPN. Check that the kernel module tun is loaded:\n    </p>\n    <blockquote>\n     <code>\n      lsmod | grep tun\n     </code>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n     It should show that the module tun is loaded. Finally, issue the command:\n    </p>\n    <blockquote>\n     <code>\n      cat /dev/net/tun\n     </code>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n     You should see a message,\n     <code>\n      File descriptor in bad state\n     </code>\n     . That sounds like an error, but it is in fact what you need. If you see a message,\n     <code>\n      No such device\n     </code>\n     , then TUN/TAP has not been enabled on your VPS.\n    </p>\n    <h3>\n     <a id=\"1-5\">\n     </a>\n     1.5. Download Script\n    </h3>\n    <p>\n     Download the Nyr OpenVPN installer script from\n     <a href=\"https://github.com/Nyr/openvpn-install\" target=\"_blank\">\n      GitHub\n     </a>\n     :\n    </p>\n    <blockquote>\n     <code>\n      wget --no-check-certificate https://git.io/vpn -O openvpn-install.sh\n     </code>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n     Before you run the script:\n    </p>\n    <ol>\n     <li>\n      Make a note of the public IP address of your server.\n     </li>\n     <li>\n      A NAT IPv4 VPS typically includes only 20 ports for your use, plus one extra for SSH. Choose one of the ports allocated to your NAT IPv4 VPS that you will use for OpenVPN.\n     </li>\n    </ol>\n    <h3>\n     <a id=\"1-6\">\n     </a>\n     1.6. Run Script\n    </h3>\n    <p>\n     Run the script with bash:\n    </p>\n    <blockquote>\n     <code>\n      bash openvpn-install.sh\n     </code>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n     The exact questions the installer asks will vary, depending on the networking configuration of your VPS. The questions might cover:\n    </p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>\n      What is the public IPv4 address or hostname of the server\n     </li>\n     <li>\n      Which IPv6 address should be used\n     </li>\n     <li>\n      Which protocol should OpenVPN use (UDP or TCP)\n     </li>\n     <li>\n      What port should OpenVPN listen on (which will have to be one of the ports allocated to your VPS)\n     </li>\n     <li>\n      Which DNS server should be pushed to the clients (current system resolvers, Google, 1.1.1.1, OpenDNS, Quad9 or AdGuard)\n     </li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>\n     You are also asked to enter a name for the first client. We will use as an example the name\n     <code>\n      westcoast\n     </code>\n     .\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     At the end of the script’s run, you will have a client configuration file named\n     <code>\n      westcoast.ovpn\n     </code>\n     (in our example). Rerun the script if you have more than one client.\n    </p>\n    <h2>\n     <a id=\"2\">\n     </a>\n     2. Clients\n    </h2>\n    <h3>\n     <a id=\"2-1\">\n     </a>\n     2.1. Download Client Configuration Files to Local PC\n    </h3>\n    <p>\n     You need to get the configuration file on to your OpenVPN client.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     The easiest way to securely download file(s) to your device(s) is to first download them to a PC on your LAN, where they will be behind a firewall. If the PC itself is not the client, you can then copy them from the PC to your final client(s).\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     To download to a Linux PC, go to your PC and use the\n     <code>\n      scp\n     </code>\n     command. For example, if your server public IP address is\n     <code>\n      yy.yy.yy.yy\n     </code>\n     , your server SSH port is\n     <code>\n      321\n     </code>\n     , and your client file is named\n     <code>\n      westcoast.ovpn\n     </code>\n     :\n    </p>\n    <blockquote>\n     <code>\n      scp -P 321 root@yy.yy.yy.yy:westcoast.ovpn ~/Downloads/westcoast.ovpn\n     </code>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n     To download to a Windows PC, you can use the\n     <code>\n      pscp.exe\n     </code>\n     command that comes with\n     <a href=\"https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n      PuTTY\n     </a>\n     . Here is a sample command that you would enter into a Windows Command Prompt. In this example, the server public IP address is\n     <code>\n      yy.yy.yy.yy\n     </code>\n     , your server SSH port is\n     <code>\n      321\n     </code>\n     , and your client file is named\n     <code>\n      westcoast.ovpn\n     </code>\n     .\n    </p>\n    <blockquote>\n     <code>\n      \"C:\\Program Files\\PuTTY\\pscp.exe\" -P 321 root@yy.yy.yy.yy:westcoast.ovpn Downloads\\westcoast.ovpn\n     </code>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n     If the PC is also your client for OpenVPN, you would use the downloaded OpenVPN configuration file directly. If a mobile device is your client, you would securely transfer the OVPN file from your PC to your mobile device.\n    </p>\n    <h3>\n     <a id=\"2-2\">\n     </a>\n     2.2. Linux Client\n    </h3>\n    <p>\n     Assuming you are using GNOME desktop, install the OpenVPN client as follows.
